    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I created this journal to chronicle my journey through the victories and frustrations of learning how to code.</p>

    <p>Earlier this summer I inquired about a coding bootcamp and signed up for a 24-week course at UT Austin. I had entertained the idea of coding on and off, but I kept putting it off because it seemed so daunting. A lot of aspects still are; I'm really new to it! But the more I do it, the more things click.</p>

    <p>This bootcamp has been the push I needed to finally get the ball rolling. I tend to thrive in a group setting where I can draw motivation and a sense of accountability. The same went for a fitness bootcamp I attended when my kids were little. That bootcamp was the final push I needed to get back to pre-baby shape.</p>

    <p>Anyhow... I hope you enjoy this journal. My first entry was written three days after my first class, and as you'll see, some pages won't be written up in the same format.</p>

<p>As you'll notice in the first few entries, there's no way to navigate other than backing out of them, but I'm going to leave those design flaws in place as a way of tracking my progress throughout the program.</p>

<p>I've also included a few resources below that I was either introduced to in class or discovered on my own time. These have all been instrumental in my progress.</p>
