<p>Just a disorganized mess of post-midnight ramblings...</p>
<p>I've been trying to wean myself from referencing previous code or looking for tips online until I'm just absolutely stumped. It's become a bit of an obsession, considering I'm up at 12:40 when I need to be at work at nine in the morning! 
    </p>
    <p>
On the bright side, I did make a lot of progress in some ways in the couple of hours that I spent practicing. I'm loving CodePen and being able to see changes in real-time. I'm making notes to myself in each pen to look back and see what I struggled with, along with questions on how to fix the things I broke. I feel like I was able to make more sense of applying specific styles to their respective attributes without making the CSS overly clunky. But I'll definitely need more practice to make everything stick.
    </p>
    <p>I'm hoping that class will help things click, because it feels like every time I get something, I break another thing. ARGH! 
</p>
Couldn't even remember how to link my CSS file. I'm amazed I even got this page to load at all. HA.
