            <p>The past couple of classes have been extremely fast-paced, and I'm finding myself scrambling to complete activities
                that we're assigned throughout the class (thankfully not for a grade!). To make sure I'm actually grasping
                the concepts, I'll take these activities home with me and work with them on my own time. I'd love to see
                just how long I spend on any given activity. It sure won't be nice to see, but probably also good to know.</p>
            <p>Below is just one example of one I didn't complete during class - turns out that I was overthinking it way too
                much!
            </p>
            <div class="diagrams">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column2">
                        <img src="codepen.png" height=300 width=400>
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column2">
                        <img src="codepen2.png" height=300 width=400>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="column2">
                        <p class="description">The text here went a little off the rails. Initially it worked just fine with lorem ipsum, but when
                            I tested it to see if the text would push into the next row, well, it didn't happen.</p>

                    <div class="column2">
                        <p class="description">After what seemed like several agonizing hours trying to fix it, here's the solution. As you can
                            see in the CSS, literally all I had to do was add {display: grid;} into the body. *facepalm*</p>

            <p>I started on my second homework assignment, which incorporates our Basic Portfolio that we built for the homework
                we submitted today. I breezed through one part, and I'm going to tackle the rest of it throughout the week.
                In the meantime I'm going to take a little bit of time to incorporate each skill I'm picking up into this
                website.
            </p>
            <p>At first I was going to incorporate more Bootstrap components into this one, but after a long day of battling
                with grids and floats, I'm going to save it for another time. In my rather limited exposure to it thus far,
                I feel like it'll make
                <em>much</em> more sense once I get the hang of JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I just thought of one more thing that tripped me up pretty badly when practicing in CodePen. Apparently if you
                type one long word, it doesn't automatically wrap; it just spills right out of the container. I had gotten
                into this habit of typing some long string of random characters, such as ajfd;ljadlfja, and when I googled
                the problem, another facepalm ensued with that discovery. Sure enough, a regular sentence will fit just
                fine.
