        <p>My eyes are burning... I can't even write up a new CSS style sheet for this one. Or, I should say, I
            <em>won't</em>.
        </p>
        <p>HOWEVER. I think I've *mostly* gotten nesting and divs and inherits and all that good stuff down. I worked on CodePen for
            a good while, only referring to other code/Google for the little things. Like fancy box shadows and making my
            links fancy so they're not the ugly blue/purple underlined atrocities that are so 1990s lol.

        <p>Here's something I was working on a little earlier today. My homework assignment for this week is split into two options: a basic and recommended version. I knocked out the basic one on Saturday right after class while everything was still fresh in my mind. I set up camp at Starbucks and got right to it. And I have to say, not having the distractions of home (mostly the mess!!) really helped me focus. Later that day I started the recommended project, and I've been working on it throughout the week. I wasn't really getting the portfolio part, so I practiced on it in CodePen. Here's an image from that activity:</p>

        <p>I'm learning very quickly just how cumbersome it is to keep files disorganized. My folders are all over the place,
            and when it's all said and done it'll be quite the ride linking all the paths appropriately.</p>
