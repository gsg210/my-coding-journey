            <p>I'm scrambling to get my homework done by early afternoon tomorrow so that I can take a deep dive into JavaScript.</p>
            <p>We broke out into groups today in an attempt to write a rock paper scissors game in JavaScript. Honestly I had little to no clue what was going on, so I really need to catch up over the weekend.</p>
            <p>In theory, it seems fun. But I can only imagine the frustration that awaits with next week's homework. Thankfully, there is apparently a lot of similar syntax between JavaScript and C++, which Rick is fairly familiar with.</p>
            <p>Even with CSS there are still so many facets I have yet to learn. And I look forward to doing so. I've become much more aware of responsive layouts, whereas before I just took them for granted. Not scrolling horizontally to view content was just not something on my radar a few short weeks ago. Unfortunately, for anyone who reads through this journal, there will be quite a few of them. Perhaps later on I can keep them in their original state, then link to the "solution," if you will. And the farther along I progress, the less need there will be for a separate solution page. That's the hope, anyhow.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, unlike with many other endeavors I've undertaken, this one is daunting but not to the point that I feel like giving up. It's frustrating, even maddening to see the hours fly by when writing (and rewriting) code. But it does pay off!</p>
            <p>I will be back at it again in the morning - TGIF! Friday's my "day off" - I say that loosely because I know I'll be spending hours on this homework assignment that's due on Saturday morning. But for now, it's WAY past my bedtime!</p>
