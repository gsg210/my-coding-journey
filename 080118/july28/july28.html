<h2>Week 1 Continued: Roadblocks</h2>
<p>Today's class was... humbling, to say the least.</p>
<p>Our first activity covered relative paths, of which the first three I breezed right through. Couldn't figure out the fourth (and last) one for the life of me. Fortunately, we got the solution so I'll need to follow up on that.</p>
<p>Our next activities covered floating and positioning, both of which were quite the challenge. I thought I'd do just fine once I went hands-on with it, but no such luck.</p>
<p>Just so the concepts would stay fresh(ish) in my mind, I headed straight to Starbucks to plug away at our basic assignment. It took about 2 hours, but I made it through. Some parts of it took longer than others, of course, but I'm hoping that the more I incorporate into my homework and practice, the more proficient I'll get.</p>
<p>The recommended assignment is a beast. I started the basics of it, and ended up toiling for hours over the front page. It still needs quite a few tweaks.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we were introduced to CodePen, which allows you to work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript side-by-side so you can see your changes in real-time. Cool stuff.</p>
<p>Looking forward to getting the hang of this more. And I'm planning to meet up with classmates on Friday to go over concepts and homework.</p>
