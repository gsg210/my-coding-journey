            <p>I wrote up this wireframe over the course of several hours, with the help of several tutorials online and an
                unspeakable amount of fails in CodePen.</p>
            <p>It's a model of the portfolio I submitted in class last Saturday, hence the placeholder image and the non-functional
                links. We're moving through class at lightning speed. This coming week our assignment again has two options:
                a simple guessing game or a hangman game. And I'm looking forward (maybe lol) to the hangman game, because
                we get to add our own theme to it. Of course I'm going to Spurs it up! </p>
            <p>But in the meantime I really need to get as much practice as possible on mastering this CSS grid. I feel like
                some of it was a little hacky, but I'll work on it. The point is, I got it to do what I wanted to at a breakpoint
                of 640px. Woo!</p>
            <p>So if you have a chance, feel free to pull this up on your phone, or if you're using Chrome, right click > Inspect
                and you'll be able to see it as you would on a number of different smartphone and tablet screens.</p>
            <p>I still have a little bit to go, namely plugging in the original elements from the first assignment. But I cleared
                the big hurdle. Yay me! Now I can finally rest, as I should as we near 2 AM here!</p>
